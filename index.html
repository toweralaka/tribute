                The language of motherhood knows no borders. There is nothing that a mother will not dare or do for <br>
                her children and family. We often don’t realize just how much they love us, we never <br>
                really appreciate how much they’ve done for us until they are no more. The loss of a mother <br>
                is very painful and sad.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                My mum was such a loving wife, a caring mum, fantastic sister, a beloved daughter and the best friend anyone could wish for.<br>
                “My mum would sit down and listen to anything that people were saying. She had time for anyone and everyone.<br>
                “Anyone would wish for a friend like my mum.<br>
                “I hope life is better where you are now my beautiful angel. I miss you more than you know and my heart aches <br>
                everytime i remeber you are gone. Goodbye Mum. Until we meet to part no more.<br>

                No words can describe the feeling when I realize that you are no more. It’s a feeling like no other. No one can really <br>
                understand the pain of going through life without such an important part of you.<br>
                You passed on just too soon. Most times it feels like it was yesterday, and other times it feels like it’s been hundreds of years since <br>
                I last saw your warm and bubbly face.I haven’t the slightest clue where you could be in the afterlife, but I really wish I could see <br>
                you again. The only thing I remember is your persistence and fiery attitude. As a single mother, you provided everything we <br>
                needed. I long for your warm hugs every time my heart is broken. I often wish you could come back and see my beautiful sister. She’s <br>
                strong, just like you. She’s overcome so much since you left. I wish you could see my son.The only memory I hold is the withering <br>
                photographs and the faint memories. I remember getting into trouble for giving my little brother wedgies, or for eating too much <br>
                candy. I often wonder what lessons you’d have taught me if you were still around. Could I have missed out on something that others <br>
                get from their mothers? I’ll never know.<br>
                I wish i had the chance to say goodbye – one last hug. I wish your life had been easier. You had to endure a lot for us. But you’d <br>
                have been proud of me on my college graduation. I wish you were around on my wedding day, when I walked down the aisle.<br>
<br>
                I hope you are in a better place looking down on us and nodding your head in approval. I want to tell you and the world you’ll always <br>
                be in our hearts forever. I love you mom!!<br>

                If roses grow in heaven,<br>
                Lord please pick a bunch for me,<br>
                Place them in my Mother’s arms<br>
                and tell her they’re from me.Tell her I love her and miss her,<br>
                and when she turns to smile,<br>
                place a kiss upon her cheek<br>
                and hold her for awhile.Because remembering her is easy,<br>
                I do it every day,<br>
                but there’s an ache within my heart<br>
                that will never go away. Adieu Mum!
